//Creating a singly linked list

/*
	To create a linked list the first step is to define
	a node object that will point to the next node. 

	For the linked list it should have a ponter to point to the node 
	of the linked list, It should have methods for
	adding and removing nodes from the list. 
*/

/*First, create object that has one property head(a pointer)
to create add elements, willuse a push method in prototype
of the object
*/

//class
function LinkedList(){
	this.head = null;
}

/*
	Push method will take value and will create a node object.
	if there is no head, then node will be the value of head.
	If there is a head, go through the linked list chain to read
	the tail(tail is defined as where the next node is === null)
